# Introduction

This game is a two-player game with a turn-based system. Each player controls a worm and tries to defeat his opponent. Players can attack each other with weapons like Bomb and Kamehameha. After the weapon hits the player, it will cause some damage. The game ends when any of a player dies.

# How to Play
